          Kylliki has been diving deeply into matters of the unconscious for more that 15 years. Her work as a Marriage and Family therapist has given her plentiful opportunities to explore the unconscious patterns that guide our daily lives.
          <br><br>
          The Systemic Constellation work takes this further and expands the process to include the family system.
          <br><br>
          Kylliki has a master’s degree in Spiritual Psychology and Counseling Psychology from University of Santa Monica as well as hundreds of hours of experience in Jungian work at the Jung Institute of Los Angeles.
          <br><br>
          She is an authorized Continuum Movement teacher, thus bringing body awareness into her psychotherapy practice and has supported people with a plethora of different challenges - including depression, addiction, anxiety, eating disorders and body image issues, life transitions and serious illnesses, creative blocks, acculturation and many more.
          <br><br>
          Kylliki believes that we all have an innate ability to heal and move towards inner harmony and wholeness. She assists her clients in attuning to their own wisdom, creativity and healing capabilities.
          <br><br>
          Kylliki’s personal experience of living in both in Europe and in the USA has given her a deeper understanding of the challenges that people are facing while adjusting to foreign cultures.

              Kylliki sees the therapeutic process as a collaborative relationship between client and therapist, honoring each client’s uniqueness.
              <br><br>
              Her intention is to assist clients to release their old "story" from their body and psyche, and fully accept themselves whilst integrating all their previously disowned parts.
              <br><br>
              In her sessions in addition to talk therapy, she uses dreamwork, sandplay, healing memories, mindfulness, movement, guided imagery, constellation work and EMDR.

              Continuum Movement is a sound and movement practice that supports us in consciously inhabiting our bodies. This meditative movement is evoked by breath and sound, inviting our attention to honor and follow the subtlest signals from inside the body, thus trusting the healing wisdom of our own bodies.
              <br><br>
              Continuum Movement founder Emilie Conrad saw our bodies as a process in time instead of something “ready-made”.
              <br><br>
              It is an essential addition to talk-therapy, allowing us access to the emotional material that is stored in our bodies.

              The founder of analytical psychology C. G. Jung said: “The things that have the most powerful effect upon children do not come from the conscious state of the parents but from their unconscious background.”
              <br><br>
              Imagine now that those invisible unconscious patterns that our parents have carried are originating from several generations back and prevent us from moving forward in our lives, sabotaging our success and our relationships.
              <br><br>
              Systemic Constellation work helps us to make visible these forces that have been holding us hostage and guiding us in our daily lives. With the help of representatives and the group field we have an opportunity to uncover where the flow of energy has been blocked in the system.
              <br><br>
              Systemic Constellation work can also be helpful in looking at any relationships we have, both inner and outer, supporting our creative projects and helping us remove the blockages that hinder us from moving forward in our lives.
              <br><br>
              This work could also be modified into individual sessions when a group is not available or the client is not ready for group work.
